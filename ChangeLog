Build 42

Introduce GNU build system (autotools)
Introduce proper versioning system (build numbers, this changelog)
Project is now licensed as free software under the GNU GPL version 3
2 dependencies eliminated - libboost_system and libboost_thread
1 dependency introduced - libpthread
Update README.md
Flopstest is optional and now broken
Cubic operation is optional

Build 41

Split code up more
Add base for cbc (solve cubic equation), experimental function.

Build 40

Update README.md

Build 39

Reduce precision to 500 significant figures
Fixed definition of 'sf' operation in main.cpp
Precision of printed answers can now be hacked by editing amath-ng.hpp, see README.md

Build 38

Update README.md

Build 37

Update README.md

Build 36

Update README.md

Build 35

Add getf (get factors)
Split compilation (amath-ng.hpp and amath-ng.cpp)
Update LICENSE and .gitignore
Remove amath-ng.pro as it is useless
You can now use amath-ng.hpp in your own programs!
Add more options to Makefile (install and clean)

Build 34

Add lcm (least common multiple)
Renamed gcf to gcd (greatest common denominator), fixed bug with
opcode.hpp, gcd was not registered as an operation in previous release
but was renamed

Build 33

Add logb (logarithm with custom base)
Minor bugfixes and typo fixes

Build 32

Fix minor typo

Build 31

Notes on inverse trigonometric functions

Build 30

Add inverse trigonometric functions (csc, sec, cot, acsc, asec, acot)

Build 29

Add half life
Higher range of random seeds (32 bit -> 64 bit)
Random number generator faster (mt19937_64 -> mt19937) mersenne twister

Build 28

Fix prm (prime) operation
Now uses trial division, therefore is slower but accurate
Add pprm - Print x first primes

Build 27

Begin work to fix primality test operation
Organize operation list
Remove version numbers

Build 26

Add law of sines and law of cosines
Notes on trigonometric functions sin, cos, tan

Build 25

Remove unnecessary headers, move include statements around

Build 24

Add circumference

Build 23

<broken>

Build 22

Order is now infinite precision like all other operations

Build 21

Add order, can only handle doubles

Build 20

Add z-score

Build 19

Organize code
Remove printAns function and replace all calls to regular output to stdout

Build 18

Add standard deviation, remove unneeded header

Build 17

Add average (mean) and remove prime
Updated compiler on build system to GCC 6.0.0, 4 headers removed:
all objects of type cpp_int changed to mpz_int
Rescued sig fig and GCF ops
Vertex op bug fix
Library GMP C++ no longer required for compilation (turns out never),
only GMP C
C++11 -> C++14

Build 16

Add compound interest

Build 15

Add percent error

Build 14

Add psq and ppwr operations

Build 13

Add ability to specify RNG seed

Build 12

Add natural logarithm (ln) and log10
Add ability to specify seed for random number gen <later found broken>
Random number gen displays seed on execution
Bugfixes

Build 11

Add seed functionality to rand
Add cube root (cbrt)
Exp now takes decimal exponents

Build 10

More bugfixes

Build 9

Hotfix for asin, acos, atan

Build 8

Added trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)

Build 7

Add LICENSE, README.md, and flopstest.hpp
Add flopstest operation, see how fast your computer can do math!
2 new dependencies - Boost.Thread and Boost.System

Build 6

Added hypotenuse calculator

Build 5

Optimizations for prime

Build 4

Hotfix 2 for vertex
Bugfixes

Build 3

Hotfix for vertex

Build 2

Add vertex operation

Build 1
